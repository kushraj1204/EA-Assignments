In Bank Application we don't need eager loading anymore because the service class is now annotated with @Transactional.
This means that each method in AccountService is a unit of work, and all the actions defined within it happen during the same
transaction using the same persistence context. Since the constituent entities are now accessed within the same method for during dto mapping, 
LazyInitializationException doesn't occur and hence we don't need eager loading anymore.
