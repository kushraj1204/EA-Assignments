In Bank Application we don't need eager loading anymore because the service class is now annotated with @Transactional.
This means that each method in AccountService is a unit of work, and all the actions within it happen during the same
transaction using the same persistence context. So, because of this the LazyInitializationException doesn't occur and hence
we don't need eager loading anymore.
